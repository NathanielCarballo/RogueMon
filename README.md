# RogueMon

A PokÃ©mon roguelike game developed with a modern web-based frontend and a modular Python backend.

## ðŸ§± Structure

- **`frontend/`** â€“ Vite + React UI (clean, fast SPA)
- **`backend/`**
  - `roguecore/` â€“ Production-grade modular game logic
  - `MVP/` â€“ Early battle engine prototypes (CLI only)
  - `main.py` â€“ Entry point (future Flask API or CLI)

## ðŸ’¡ Development Workflow

We follow **trunk-based development**:
- All changes start in `feature/*` branches
- Pull requests are reviewed and merged to `main`
- Both backend and frontend share this monorepo

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

- Frontend: see `frontend/README.md`
- Backend: see `backend/README.md`
